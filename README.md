# Contact tracing system 
This project aims at tracing whether an individual was in contact with an infected person. 
The contact tracing system can predict whether an individual has been in close contact with an infected person based on various factors. 
It will assist public health institutions in managing the spread of infectious disease

# Learning outcomes: 

1.Understanding of Machine Learning concepts: Knowledge of how machine learning techniques work in the real world 
Data preprocessing: Learning how to clean, format, and handle missing values in a dataset 
2.Exploratory Data Analysis EDA: Analyzing data to understand relationships between features and target variable
3.4.Supervised Machine Learning algorithms: Implementing and comparing the performance of Supervised Machine Learning algorithms
like SVM (Support Vector Machine),K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes
Use of evaluation metrics: Checking the accuracy of the trained machine using different evaluation metrics like 
MSE (Mean Squared Error), R-squared, and MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

# What it takes to execute this project:

1.Set up the development environment by installing Python and its libraries 
2.Generate the required data like location, time, duration of encounters, and personal details of individuals 
3.Preprocess the data by cleaning and handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling 
Split data into two parts: training and testing datasets and use of algorithms like SVM, KNN, and Naive Bayes to train the model
4.Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance with different evaluation metrics 
5.Use the system to make predictions on new contact tracing data

# Real world applications: 

1.Public health authorities can use the system to quickly identify and monitor individuals who might be exposed 
to a contiguous disease and prevent the spread of the outbreak
2.During a pandemic, this system can be integrated with a larger healthcare system to track the movement of an infected individual and their contacts
